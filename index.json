In addition to optimized flight operations and Sustainable Aviation Fuels deployment, two fundamental enablers to reach this target are the introduction of LH2 technologies and new solutions increasing aircraft and engine efficiency. In order to accelerate the Entry Into Service of ultra-efficient hydrogen SMR aircraft, AWATAR develops a Very High Aspect Ratio, Strut-Braced, Dry-Wing characterized by laminar portions in the outer areas, advanced integrated leading edge systems and an optimized integration of an open-rotor propulsion system. With the purpose of anticipating and accelerating future certification processes, the targeted maturation relies on high-fidelity simulations and ground tests (ETW, S2MA, Collins’ Icing wind tunnel).\nIn terms of performance benefits, progress to be made in AWATAR leads to substantial gains with respect to a 2020 state-of-the-art aircraft. The novel aerodynamic configuration with a large aspect ratio targets a drag reduction at aircraft level of 18%. Regarding the Advanced Leading Edge solution integrating the ice protection system, the investigated technology aims for a 50% reduction of the energy budget needed for a fully evaporative system. For laminarity, the expected aircraft drag reduction is about 5-10% depending on the configuration. In addition, the optimized integration of the Unducted Single Fan limits installation drag to less than 4% of total aircraft drag. Overall, AWATAR aims at an integrated SMR aircraft (250 passengers - 2000 nm) offering an 18% reduction in block energy. This 36 months, 20MEuros valued project (14MEuros funding) relies on a strong consortium made of 2 Aircraft manufacturers, 1 Aerospace components supplier, 3 research Centers, 1 Wind tunnel Operator and 2 universities. This complementary and multidisciplinary consortium ensures that AWATAR maturity path is in line with Clean Aviation SMR roadmap.\nOur main contribution to this project is a control co-design optimization framework aiming for gust load alleviation and weight reduction.\n","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"d1f2a7d08d3e1845734ec6dc25db606e","permalink":"/project/awatar/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/awatar/","section":"project","summary":"Advanced Wing MATuration And integRation (EU funded project).","tags":["AWATAR"],"title":"AWATAR","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This course is an MSc elective as a follow-up of AE4ASM506 Fundamentals of Aeroelasticity.

Each one of the modules is executed by two independent servos, which allows both camber and twist morphings. The wing is made in fiberGlass weave material, and its laminate design is optimized by a fluid-structure interaction tool.\nThe SmartX-Alpha prototype won the Student Hardware Competition in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) 2020 conference on smart materials, adaptive structures and intelligent systems.

This project aims at introducing novel flight control methods to mitigate the consequence of in-flight motor failures, which rarely happens but is still a big safety threat after large scale deployment of drones in the future.\nTo be specific, the project leverages incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) control method, to stabilize and control a quadrotor with failure of a single rotor or two opposing rotors, under significant aerodynamic disturbances. These strong aerodynamic effects are dominant in high-speed flight, or windy conditions. Thanks to the robustness of the INDI controller, the damaged quadrotor maintains controllable in spite of these aeordynamic disturbances.\nWe have validated the proposed controllers in a large scale wind tunnel, named Open Jet Facility at TU Delft. Despite a complete loss of one or two propellers, the tested quadrotor can maintain high-speed flight. In addition to validating the controller, these wind tunnel flight tests have produced valuable data for identifying aerodynamic models of a quadrotor, in both nominal and damaged conditions.\nAnother focus of the research aims at recovering the damaged quadrotor after motor failure. When a motor failure is detected, a quadrotor might have been entered a detrimental flight condition, such as an upside-down orientation, where the drone can hardly recover to stable flights using the state-of-art methods. Therefore, we have developed an upset recovery controller, using a novel control allocation approach.\n","date":1597449600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597449600,"objectID":"7c64e3cfdcbc41d48612c59559a549d3","permalink":"/project/quadrotorftc/","publishdate":"2020-08-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/quadrotorftc/","section":"project","summary":"In this project, we design fault-tolerant control algorithms for quadrotors with complete loss of one or more rotors in high-speed flights.","tags":["Quadrotor Fault Tolerant Control"],"title":"Quadrotor Fault Tolerant Control","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sihao Sun","Xuerui Wang","Qiping Chu","Coen de Visser"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

This increase is beneficial for the aerodynamic performance of the aircraft. Moreover, to reduce the airframe weight, composite materials are widely used in modern aircraft. For example, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft uses 80% composite by volume, and 50% composite by weight. Although composite materials provide the same load-carrying capacity with less structural weight, the resulting structural rigidity also decreases. With the coaction of high aspect-ratio and wide usage of composite materials, modern commercial aircraft are becoming more and more flexible.\nThis trend leads to considerable interactions among aerodynamics, structural dynamics, and flight dynamics.

The design of a Flying-V aircraft concept contains several benefits compared to conventional tube-and-wing aircraft. The main advantage of this type of aircraft is the reduction of wetted area and frictional drag since one structure integrates the structural function of accommodating payload and the aerodynamic function of providing lift. Furthermore, this type of aircraft suffers less from interference drag due to the smooth shape of the configuration. Additionally, the reduced wetted area per unit of useful volume results in a reduction of the zero-lift drag. Therefore, this type of aircraft can achieve a higher lift-to-drag ratio compared to conventional aircraft and hence has a reduced fuel burn and takeoff weight. Research on the aerodynamic advantages of the Flying-V presents that the aircraft can have aerodynamic efficiency gains ranging from 10% to 25% compared to conventional tube-and-wing aircraft of similar size and weight while reducing the noise level due to the location of the engines on top of the wing.

We proposed a new sensor-based incremental control framework for generic multi-input and multi-output nonlinear systems with an arbitrary relative degree. The closed-loop stability in the presence of model uncertainties and external disturbances are proved using Lyapunov methods. The robustness of the system to regular and singular perturbations are also analyzed.\nFor mitigating the chattering effect in the sliding mode control (SMC), many adaptation mechanisms have been proposed to reduce the switching gains. However, less attention is paid to the control structure, which influences the resulting uncertainty term and determines the minimum possible gains. Our research compares three control structures for inducing higher-order sliding modes in finite time: nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) based SMC, higher-order sliding mode control (HOSMC) with artificially increased relative degree, and the recently proposed incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) based SMC.\nWe also define the controllability margin (CM) and observability margin (OM) from the view of singular perturbation and regular perturbation.
