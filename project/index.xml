      <description>&lt;p&gt;AWATAR - 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-details/43108390/101140588/HORIZON&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Advanced Wing MATuration And integRation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aeronautical industry is committed to a collective goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In addition to optimized flight operations and Sustainable Aviation Fuels deployment, two fundamental enablers to reach this target are the introduction of LH2 technologies and new solutions increasing aircraft and engine efficiency.
In order to accelerate the Entry Into Service of ultra-efficient hydrogen SMR aircraft, AWATAR develops a Very High Aspect Ratio, Strut-Braced, Dry-Wing characterized by laminar portions in the outer areas, advanced integrated leading edge systems and an optimized integration of an open-rotor propulsion system. With the purpose of anticipating and accelerating future certification processes, the targeted maturation relies on high-fidelity simulations and ground tests (ETW, S2MA, Collins’ Icing wind tunnel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of performance benefits, progress to be made in AWATAR leads to substantial gains with respect to a 2020 state-of-the-art aircraft. The novel aerodynamic configuration with a large aspect ratio targets a drag reduction at aircraft level of 18%. Regarding the Advanced Leading Edge solution integrating the ice protection system, the investigated technology aims for a 50% reduction of the energy budget needed for a fully evaporative system. For laminarity, the expected aircraft drag reduction is about 5-10% depending on the configuration. In addition, the optimized integration of the Unducted Single Fan limits installation drag to less than 4% of total aircraft drag. Overall, AWATAR aims at an integrated SMR aircraft (250 passengers - 2000 nm) offering an 18% reduction in block energy. This 36 months, 20MEuros valued project (14MEuros funding) relies on a strong consortium made of 2 Aircraft manufacturers, 1 Aerospace components supplier, 3 research Centers, 1 Wind tunnel Operator and 2 universities. This complementary and multidisciplinary consortium ensures that AWATAR maturity path is in line with Clean Aviation SMR roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main contribution to this project is a control co-design optimization framework aiming for gust load alleviation and weight reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;UpWing - 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101101974&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ultra Performance Wing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU’s Clean Aviation objectives aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, noise and other pollutants from aviation activities in Europe. In this context, the EU-funded UP Wing project will develop key technologies for ultra-efficient short/medium-range aircraft. Specifically, it will integrate ultra-performance wing concepts with the aim of achieving a minimum fuel burn reduction of 30 % compared to the state-of-the-art reference Aircraft A321neo. Bringing together an interdisciplinary consortium consisting of airframe integrators, industry, research establishments, and academia, the project will develop enabling technologies. The project’s outcomes will be well aligned with the development plans of future aircraft entering into service in 2035 with 75 % market penetration until 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sketch of the project can be found in this 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjrX6GvPGD8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;YouTube Vedio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main contribution to this project is a nonlinear, data-driven control algorithm designed to reduce gust-induced loads on the wing in transonic flow conditions. This will result in reduced structural weight and improved efficiency. This control approach will be validated through transonic wind tunnel experiments in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Seamless Active Morphing Wing</title>
      <link>/project/seamlessmorphing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Active morphing indicates the ability to transform structural shape in a controlled way. Inspired by birds, the active morphing wing can adapt its shape in different flight conditions for optimizing the aerodynamic performance. Moreover, wing morphing surfaces can be used as direct lift control devices for alleviating the structural loads caused by gusts and maneuvers. Furthermore, wing morphing can execute flight control commands with reduced drag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Smart and Aeroelastic Structure research group in Delft University of Technology has designed, manufactured, and tested a seamless active morphing wing named 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdagIiYRWyA&amp;amp;t=316s&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SmartX-Alpha&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It has six translation-induced camber morphing trailing edge modules, interconnected seamlessly by elastomer materials. Each one of the modules is executed by two independent servos, which allows both camber and twist morphings. The wing is made in fiberGlass weave material, and its laminate design is optimized by a fluid-structure  interaction tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SmartX-Alpha prototype won the Student Hardware Competition in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) 2020 conference on smart materials, adaptive structures and intelligent systems. If you would like to know more, please check the

      <title>Quadrotor Fault Tolerant Control</title>
      <link>/project/quadrotorftc/</link>

      <guid>/project/quadrotorftc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the most commonly used and simplest multi-rotor drones, quadrotors are
especially vulnerable to rotor failures because they lack rotor redundancy. This project aims at introducing novel flight control methods to mitigate the consequence of in-flight motor failures, which rarely happens but is still a big safety threat after large scale deployment of drones in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be specific, the project leverages incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) control method, to stabilize and control a quadrotor with failure of a 
&lt;a href=&#34;/publication/highspeedral/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;single rotor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or 
&lt;a href=&#34;/publication/incrementalnonlinear/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;two opposing rotors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, under significant aerodynamic disturbances. These strong aerodynamic effects are dominant in high-speed flight, or windy conditions. Thanks to the robustness of the INDI controller, the damaged quadrotor maintains controllable in spite of these aeordynamic disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have validated the proposed controllers in a large scale wind tunnel, named 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tudelft.nl/lr/organisatie/afdelingen/aerodynamics-wind-energy-flight-performance-and-propulsion/facilities/low-speed-wind-tunnels/open-jet-facility/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Jet Facility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at TU Delft. Despite a complete loss of one or two propellers, the tested quadrotor can maintain high-speed flight. In addition to validating the controller, these wind tunnel flight tests have produced valuable data for identifying 
&lt;a href=&#34;/project/quadrotormodeling&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;aerodynamic models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of a quadrotor, in both nominal and damaged conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another focus of the research aims at recovering the damaged quadrotor after motor failure. When a motor failure is detected, a quadrotor might have been entered a detrimental flight condition, such as an upside-down orientation, where the drone can hardly recover to stable flights using the state-of-art methods.
Therefore, we have developed an 
&lt;a href=&#34;/publication/upsetrecovery/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;upset recovery controller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, using a novel control allocation approach.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flexible Aircraft Control</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Increasing the aspect-ratio of the wing is a trend in modern commercial aircraft design. This increase is beneficial for the aerodynamic performance of the aircraft. Moreover, to reduce the airframe weight, composite materials are widely used in modern aircraft. For example, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft uses 80% composite by volume, and 50% composite by weight. Although composite materials provide the same load-carrying capacity with less structural weight, the resulting structural rigidity also decreases. With the coaction of high aspect-ratio and wide usage of composite materials, modern commercial aircraft are becoming more and more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trend leads to considerable interactions among aerodynamics, structural dynamics, and flight dynamics. If not harnessed properly, the interactions can lead to severe structural vibrations and even instabilities. In view of this, we conduct interdisciplinary research on flexible aircraft dynamic control with multiple objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flutter suppression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gust and maneuver load alleviation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handling quality and passenger comfort enhancement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic trajectory control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fault-tolerant control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>The Flying-V Aircraft</title>
      <link>/project/flyingv/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/flyingv/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ae/flying-v&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flying-V&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a specific type of flying wing that is tailless, V-shaped, and consists of two cylindrical pressurised cabins located at the leading edge of the wing. The design of a Flying-V aircraft concept contains several benefits compared to conventional tube-and-wing aircraft. The main advantage of this type of aircraft is the reduction of wetted area and frictional drag since one structure integrates the structural function of accommodating payload and the aerodynamic function of providing lift. Furthermore, this type of aircraft suffers less from interference drag due to the smooth shape of the configuration. Additionally, the reduced wetted area per unit of useful volume results in a reduction of the zero-lift drag. Therefore, this type of aircraft can achieve a higher lift-to-drag ratio compared to conventional aircraft and hence has a reduced fuel burn and takeoff weight. Research on the aerodynamic advantages of the Flying-V presents that the aircraft can have aerodynamic efficiency gains ranging from 10% to 25% compared to conventional tube-and-wing aircraft of similar size and weight while reducing the noise level due to the location of the engines on top of the wing. This project focuses on the dynamic modelling, handling quality assessment, and control design for the Flying V aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The main goal of this research is to improve aircraft safety by developing advanced nonlinear control methods that can tolerate actuator faults, structural damage and atmospheric disturbances. One of the featured methods is the incremental sliding mode control, which is a hybrid between the sensor-based incremental control and the robust sliding mode control.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nonlinear Control Theory</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This page contains our contributions to the control community. We proposed a new sensor-based incremental control framework for generic multi-input and multi-output nonlinear systems with an arbitrary relative degree. The closed-loop stability in the presence of model uncertainties and external disturbances are proved using Lyapunov methods. The robustness of the system to regular and singular perturbations are also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For mitigating the chattering effect in the sliding mode control (SMC), many adaptation mechanisms have been proposed to reduce the switching gains. However, less attention is paid to the control structure, which influences the resulting uncertainty term and determines the minimum possible gains. Our research compares three control structures for inducing higher-order sliding modes in finite time: nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) based SMC, higher-order sliding mode control (HOSMC) with artificially increased relative degree, and the recently proposed incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) based SMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also define the controllability margin (CM) and observability margin (OM) from the view of singular perturbation and regular perturbation. The model error structure (MES) is proposed as a structural property metric for linear systems based on the novel concepts of singular perturbation margin (SPM) and generalized gain margin (GGM).&lt;/p&gt;
